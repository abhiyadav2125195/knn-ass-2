    "Euclidean Distance: Measures the straight-line or \"as-the-crow-flies\" distance between two points in a multidimensional space.\n",
    "Manhattan Distance: Also known as the L1 distance or city block distance, it calculates the distance as the sum of the absolute differences along each dimension.\n",
    "The choice between these distance metrics can significantly affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor. Euclidean distance gives more importance to differences in all dimensions, making it sensitive to the scale of features. If features have different units or scales, Euclidean distance may be biased towards features with larger scales. Manhattan distance, on the other hand, is less sensitive to feature scaling and can be a better choice when feature scales vary widely."

    "Manhattan Distance: Is less sensitive to feature scaling and can perform better when features have different units or the data distribution is irregularly shaped or has outliers.\n",
